        How to preserve gemstone jewelry to keep it bright and beautiful
    </h1>

            To ensure your favorite piece of jewelry is always as shiny as when you first bought it, you should pay attention to how to care for and clean gemstones.

    <p>
        First, to preserve gemstone jewelry, you should know some basic information about the hardness and characteristics of the stone. Each gemstone will have different hardness and they are determined based on the Mohs hardness scale.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most durable hardness belongs to 4 types of gemstones including diamond, emerald, Sapphire and Ruby. In order to protect and minimize collisions with the stone, when crafting, jewelers often combine it with other metals such as gold and silver to cover the gem. This also helps make gemstone jewelry more durable and safer.

                    1. Limit impact when using gemstone jewelry

        <p class="pdlr-pearl">
            To avoid impact and breakage, you should not wear jewelry with stones 24/7, when exercising vigorously, playing sports or carrying heavy objects. Gemstones of different hardness should not be worn close to each other, because they easily collide and are difficult to avoid scratches.
        </p>

        <p>
            For colored stones that are not very hard, you should go to a jewelry store to cover them with gold or silver to make the jewelry more sturdy.

                        2. Do not expose gemstones to chemicals

        <p class="pdlr-pearl">
            The constituent nature of gemstones is natural chemical elements, so they tend to no longer retain their value when reacting with appropriate chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Check out" a few stones that easily react with other chemicals that you need to pay attention to when owning them. For example, coral easily fades when exposed to shower gel, shampoo, and soap. Meanwhile, nacre and pearls dissolve easily in acid. In addition, amber is very resistant to contact with perfume or chemical solvents such as Acetone nail polish remover or strong alcohol.

                    3. Care for gemstone jewelry properly
                </b>
            </p>

        <p>
            Besides limiting impact and exposure of gemstones to chemicals, a thoughtful gemstone care routine should also be performed once a month.
        </p>
        <p>
            For colored stone jewelry that has stains that have stuck for a long time, causing the stone to darken, the simplest way is to use toothpaste to make the stone shiny like new. First, put a sufficient amount of toothpaste on a toothbrush or a small brush. Then, brush every corner of the gemstone jewelry and rinse with clean water. Finally, dry the jewelry with a towel or you can also use a dryer.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, to most effectively clean your favorite gemstone jewelry, bring it to jewelry stores for dedicated staff support. This doesn't take too much time and also ensures that your expensive jewelry is well taken care of.
